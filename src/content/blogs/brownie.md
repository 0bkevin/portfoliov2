Actually, Brownie is one of the most popular frameworks to create smart contracts, alongside truffle and hardhat.

*Brownie offers a lot of cool things and functionalities you can use to make your development process more simple.*

So, whether you're starting your journey as a blockchain developer, or you already have experience with smart contract development in Javascript but you want to shift to python, this tutorial is for you.

**We’ll walk through and explore all the main areas of functionality and I'll give you some tricks you can use to make your development process more easy.**

**Let's start!**

## How to install brownie

There are two easy ways in which you can install brownie:

**1\. By using pipx**

`pipx` is just a like `pip`, but you can install those packages and run it directly in the command line

Is focused on installing and managing Python packages that can be run from the command line directly as applications.

> Whereas `pip` is a general-purpose package installer for both libraries and apps with no environment isolation. `pipx` **is made specifically for application installation, as it adds isolation yet still makes the apps available in your shell:** `pipx` creates an isolated environment for each application and its associated packages.

From the [pipx documentation.](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#how-is-it-different-from-pip)

That means, you don't have to create a python virtual environment when a package needed it.

I recommend using this method, if so,you just can follow along the tutorial in the brownie documentation [here.](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#installing-brownie)

**2\. Using the common python pip**

To be able to install brownie without `pipx`, you first need to create a virtual environment.

A virtual environment in python is a contained environment for separate projects on your computer 🐍. What this means is that **you can have separate virtual environments with separate versions of python and python packages for each of your projects.**

You can create one just by typing:

`$ python3 -m venv <path + name of your virtual environment>`

Example:

$ python -m venv ./myVirtualEnviroment

After the creation process is done, you will need to activate the virtual environment:

$ source myVirtualEnviroment/bin/activate

Or

$ source myVirtualEnviroment/Scripts/activate

And then, you just need to write:

$ pip install eth-brownie

With that you'll be able to use brownie.

*Take into account that this only will work in the current directory, if you change from directory you will need to create and activate a virtual environment again. Also, if you close your current session of the command line and you want to work with the project again you will need to activate the virtual environment again.*

To make sure that everything works fine, in both scenarios, write

$ brownie

If you need more information about the installation process of Brownie, you can follow [this tutorial](https://iamdefinitelyahuman.medium.com/getting-started-with-brownie-part-1-9b2181f4cb99) made **by Ben Hauser on Medium**

Also, you can follow the [brownie documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)

## Brownie basics

I'm not going to dive deep into the basics of brownie, for that the brownie team wrote an excellent documentation that you can check [here.](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)

Also, you can read these greats tutorial made by Ben Hauser, [tutorial one](https://betterprogramming.pub/getting-started-with-brownie-part-2-615a1eec167f), [tutorial two.](https://betterprogramming.pub/getting-started-with-brownie-part-3-ef6bfa9867d7)

**I'm just going to make you a resume:**

* Initialized templates for projects, so you don't have to start from scratch.
    
    `$ brownie bake <name of the template>`
    
* Compile your contracts
    
    `$ brownie compile`
    
* Write test for your contracts. Writing the test in the `test` folder and typing
    
    `$ brownie test`
    
* Can also interact with the contract using scripts or via the brownie console.
    
    In the `scripts` folder you can write your scripts to interact with the contract programmatically, and then you write:
    
    `$ brownie run scripts`
    
    Or, using the console you can interact with the contract manually.
    
    `$ brownie console`
    
* Deploy your contracts in a controlled environment (using ganache under the hood)
    
    `$ brownie deploy`
    
* And also deploy to a testnet or a real net
    
    `$ brownie deploy --network <name of the network>`
    
    You also can do this when you are testing your contracts.
    
    `$ brownie test --network <name of the network>`
    
    Or runing your scripts
    
    `$ brownie run scripts --network <name of the network>`
    
* if you need any extra information about a brownie CLI command you can always type:
    

\`$ brownie --help

## The brownie config file

*This is a special file that brownie always looks for to grab information when you are going to build, test and deploy your contract…*

This file **allows you to modify Brownie’s default behaviors and also add new sections** that can be useful for you when you are working in your smart contract.

I'm not going to deep dive in all the sections that the file have, you could see those in the [brownie documentation.](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html)

**I'm just going to explain some things that could be useful for you.**

You need to add this file to the root of your project and name it `brownie-config.yaml`

One of the things you can do is:

### Remapping import paths.

Let's say that your contract need to use some functionality from other contract, like a template or a library (the safe math library or the ERC721 standard template of [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) for example)

You can do that without copying the contract interface to your project, **you can just pull the source code from the npm package that hosts the code.**

Example, let's said that you need to import the Open Zeppelin contract *Ownable*.

For this you'll need to install the open zeppelin npm package, **but with remappings you don't need it.**

Just import the package as usual in your solidity file.

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol";

And then, in your `brownie-config.yaml` file, you can use one of it's default sections called `compiler` to change it's behavior.

* In this section you add a subsection called `solc`.
    
* And in this subsection you add another subsection called `remappings`.
    

You should have something like this:

compiler: solc: remappings:

**Each value under remappings is a string in the format of** `prefix=path`.

*A remapping instructs the compiler to search for a given prefix at a specific path*.

For example:

github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/=/usr/local/lib/dapp-bin/

This remapping instructs the compiler to search for anything starting with `github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/` under `/usr/local/lib/dapp-bin`.

*Brownie automatically ensures that all remapped paths are allowed.*

And now, if we want to use our Open Zeppelin ownable contract, **we just need to follow that prefix=path format.**

By having a prefix

`@openzeppelin`

And then, having the path that rute us to the open zeppelin package in NPM, that is usually stored on GitHub.

We can obtain that searching by googling *open zeppelin ownable contract*

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643847873973/vdLDGCg89.png align="left")

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643849387151/p_Qjfqc0-.png align="left")

And we can use this information to make the path, should be wrote in this format: &lt;organization/repo&gt;@

First, we need to add the organization, that means the username who create the repo. In this case:

`OpenZeppelin`

Then we need to add the github repo in which is store the code. In this case

`openzeppelin-contracts`

We would have something like this for the path

`OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts`

And finally, we need to add the package version we want to work with.

In the root of the repo we can see all the releases (the versions).

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643849331423/AWpD6ZL9h.png align="left")

By pressing in **releases** you can see all the different versions you can use, *this is going to depend mostly of the specifications of the project you are working on,* but you can really chose whatever you want.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643851974060/zeWT9xD5Yc.png align="left")

You need to add the version by adding an “@” at the beginning.

Example

* Working with version 4.4.1:
    
    `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.4.1`
    
* Or version 4.3.1
    
    `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.1`
    

That's it, now in your remappings section you should have something like this:

compiler: solc: remappings: - '@openzeppelin=OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.1'

Now, everytime the compiler see `@openzeppelin` in your solidity code, will search that import under the `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.1` github repo, so you don't need to install anything.

So, with this:

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol";

The compiler will search in the `contract` folder of that repo, then in the `ownership` folder and then grab the `Ownable.sol` file and download it for you.

Awesome, right? Well, **you can do this with whatever file you want,** using the prefix to tell the compiler *“hey! If you see this (prefix) search it under this folder (the path)"*

#### Adding the dependencies section.

To complete this, you can also add the `dependencies` section to the brownie config file. This section will tell brownie to *install any listed dependencies prior to compiling a project.* That could be useful when someone else download/clone your project from GitHub.

**You just need to add the path of your remap to that dependencies section.**

```yaml
dependencies:
  - OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.1
compiler:
  solc:
    remappings:
      - '@openzeppelin=OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.3.1'
```

This will create a `dependency` folder under the `build/contracts` folder. There, the artifacts of every dependencies that a contract need will be stored.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643850040466/qP1oX9mjW.png align="left")

**The** `build/contracts` folder is where all the artifacts of the projects are stored.

If you don't know, **the artifacts are the result of the compiled contract, with all the objects that we can interact with, like the bytecode of the contract, the ABI, the address…**

If you want to read more about the build folder you can check the [brownie documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/build-folder.html#the-build-folder)

### Adding new sections to grab information from.

**The brownie config file allows you to add new custom sections that you can use to store persistent data** that you could use all across your project. *You can do this in two different ways:*

#### Adding a simple section

You just add a new section, you can call it whatever you want. Let's say you want to store your private key for deploy the contracts.

my\_accounts: my\_private\_key: 'my\_super\_secret\_private\_key'

I add the section `my_accounts` and inside that section a `my_private_key` subsection and in that I store my private key.

Also I could add more subsections to that section to store more data, example:

my\_accounts: my\_private\_key: 'my\_super\_secret\_private\_key' my\_public\_key: '0x02Ba39E868bF5140e572830C019c36843860B627' my\_usename: 'kevinsito'

And even you could add a subsection inside a subsection, thats on you and whatever you want to do.

**And, you just can grab that information for use it in your scripts or your test files by using the brownie** `config` object.

You just need to import it

from brownie import config

my\_private\_key = config\["my\_accounts"\]\["my\_private\_key"\]

The first, is the section, and the second is the subsection that we are searching.

When you use it you will obtain the data that you store in your brownie config file under tat section.

Example

from Brownie import config

my\_private\_key = config\["my\_accounts"\]\["my\_private\_key"\]

print(my\_private\_key)

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643852559702/0S4-g0t5u.png align="left")

**Obviously, you don't want to store your private key in that way, it is too dangerous…** Later in the article I will teach you how you can store in a more secure way.

**You can literally do this with whatever section you want to grab information from**, not only with those you created.

#### Adding a section to grab information conditionally.

You can also store information in the brownie config file, and grab it conditionally. For example:

Let's say you only want to grab certain data when you are on the `rinkeby network`, and other data when you are on the `kovan network`. That could be a contract address.

\*\*You could do that! \*\*

Imagine your project needs to interact with a Chainlink contract, and you want to test it in all the different networks, but the address of that contract change depending on the network.

So, you could add an address for the `kovan network` and another for the `rinkeby network` inside your brownie config file, and depending on the network you are deploying or testing your contract, one of those networks would be selected

The brownie config file has a section in which you can modify all the networks default behavior, the `networks` section. You could read more about all the specifications of the network section [here.](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html#networks)

**Let's do it!**

networks: kovan: my\_chainlink\_contract\_address: 'ths\_is\_my\_chainlink\_address\_in\_kovan' rinkeby: my\_chainlink\_contract\_address: 'this\_is\_my\_chainlink\_address\_in\_rinkeby'

*And now, we can grab that information in our scripts or our test again by using the* `config` object of brownie, and specifying the section we want to grab information from.

from brownie import config

contract\_addresss=config\["networks"\]

But now, **how do we do this work depending on the network we are working?**

We can see what is the current network working with the brownie object `network` and using its function `network.show_active()`

**This will tell us what is the current active network.**

contract\_address = config\["networks"\]\[network.show\_active()\]

And then, you need to add the name of the subsection that you created in the correspondent network, **should be the same name between the networks.**

contract\_address = config\["networks"\]\[network.show\_active()\]\["my\_chainlink\_contract\_address"\]

print(contract\_address)

**Let's test it.**

$ brownie run scripts/testing.py --network rinkeby

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643909213697/jjcwl-wPL.png align="left")

Now using kovan.

$ brownie run scripts/testing.py --network kovan

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643909283220/zk07wc4yy.png align="left")

The flag `--network` is used when we want to change to which network the contract would be deployed,\* this is going to be the development network by default\* (which is a ganache cli), you can read more about that [here](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/network-management.html#launching-and-connecting)

Okay but, how brownie knows how to change between networks by just typing its name?, well brownie have an object called `network`, \*\*in which there stores a lot of different networks that we can use to deploy and test our contract. \*\* *We will see more about that later in the article.*

## Using environment variables

When you are working with smart contracts, **there are certain data that you don't want the general public to know.** Like your private key, some API key, like your alchemy or infura API key.

**To store that sensitive data we have a file called** `.env` which is a file used to store environment variables and is not uploaded to Github.

Lets create a `.env` file in the root of our project.

In this `.env` file we can store sensitive data in variables, that we can use in other parts of the project, in a very secure way.

Example:

export MY\_PRIVATE\_KEY= &lt;some\_private\_key&gt;

We need to add the “export” keyword and the begining so brownie knows that variable can be used.

And now, you can use that data in your scripts or test file, you just need to import the `os` module

import os

my\_private\_key = os.getenv(“MY\_PRIVATE\_KEY”)

And by using the `.getenv` method and passing the id of your environment variable as a parameter you can use that information in your files.

Brownie by default writes in the `.gitignore` file `.env` to avoid that file been uploaded to github (you really don't want that)

But you can check the `.gitignore` file anyways to be sure that include`.env`

**We also can use the environment variables in the** `brownie-config.yaml file`

Let's say you want to store a private key to be able to grab it in your scrips. You can just type:

my\_private key: ${MY\_PRIVATE\_KEY}

To be able to do that, you need to specify a new section in your brownie config file

dotenv: .env

With this we are saying to brownie *“hey, I want to use the* `.env` file as a file to store my environment variables, and whenever you see this strange character `${}` in our brownie config file that's going to be an environmental variable that you can grab from the `.env` file.

**With that we can use our private key in a more secure way!.**

And if you want to use the environment variables in your `.env` file in all your project, you can do it by setting the environment variables using.

source .env

This will allow you yo use all the environment variables in your command line

\*This is my .env file \*

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643908156730/ZMvmkueOS.png align="left")

You can test this by typing:

```plaintext
echo $name_of_your_env_variable
```

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643908193698/ZF46Q-Vms.png align="left")

## Working with networks

As I said earlier, **you can use brownie to deploy your contract to a local or live networks.**

You have two options here, **you can use the development environment**, which is a local, temporary network used for testing and debugging, is generating from Ganache.

Or **you can use a live environment**, a real blockchain. Could be a testnet or a real one.

Brownie have a special object called `network` that contains all the different default networks that we can use to deploy our contract.

We can see all the networks that we have in brownie by typing:

$ brownie networks list

This will show us all the different networks that we can use to deploy and test our contracts…

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643909041398/84_73R1DhR.png align="left")

We can see a more detailed list by adding "true"

$ brownie networks list true

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643909070307/eD4pvbRrH.png align="left")

With this, **you can see all the different options that the** `network` **object have.**

And you can add new networks.

$ brownie networks add \[environment\] \[id\] host=\[host\] \[KEY=VALUE, ...\]

### Network elements

* **environment:** the category that the network should be placed in, e.g. “Ethereum”, “Ethereum Classic”, or “Development”
    
* **id:** a unique identifier for the network, e.g. “mainnet”
    
* **host:** the address of the node to connect to, e.g. https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/1234567890abcdef
    
* **port:** The port to connect to. If not given as a unique field, it should be included within the host path.
    
* **accounts:** The number of funded, unlocked accounts. Default 10.
    
* **mnemonic:** A mnemonic to use when generating local accounts.
    
* **fork:** If given, the local client will fork from another currently running Ethereum client. The value may be an HTTP location and port of the other client, e.g. http://localhost:8545, or the ID of a production network, e.g. mainnet.
    
* **explorer:** the block explorer of that especific network.
    

If you are going to constantly use a network for deploying your project, and you don't want to add everytime the `--network` flag **you can set up the network that brownie is going to use by default** adding this section in your brownie config file.

networks: default: ropsten

*So the default network that brownie is going to use to deploy your contracts is going to be ropsten.*

Of course, you can change that behavior in specific occations when you are deploying your contract.

$ brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network rinkeby

*In this case the contract would be deployed on the rinkeby network*, although the default network is ropsten.

If you want to learn more about networks, you can read the [brownie documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/network-management.html)

### Adding forked network

**Let me teach you how you can add a forked network:** e That means, when you want to test your smart contract *you can literally grab a exact copy of the current ethereum mainnet and paste it for your personal use*, **so all the contracts that are in the mainnet you can use it in your project for testing without deploying mocks.**

$ brownie networks add development my-super\_mainnet-fork host=http://127.0.0.1 fork=http//:eth-mainnnet.alchemyapi/v2/ accounts=10 mnemonic=brownie port=8585

### Deleting an existing network.

If you want to delete a default network or a network you created, you just have to type:

`$ brownie networks delete <id_of_the_network>`

*Remember you can know the id of all the networks by typing:*

`$ brownie networks list true`

`$ brownie networks delete <ftm-main-fork>`

![Deleting network example](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646365126644/gtT7vdFKt.PNG align="left")

### Updating an existing network.

If you want to change some value of a network, but without rewriting the entire network, you just need to type:

`$ brownie networks modify <id_of_the_network> key=value`

Example: Let's say you want to change the gas limit of the xdai network

You just look for the network id and the element of the network you want to change and type:

`$ brownie networks modify xdai-main-fork gas_limit=210000000`

![dos.PNG](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646365524146/_QRjaA1Di.PNG align="left")

Remember not write when defining the key pair

**Good:** gas\_lilmit=210000000 **bad:** gas\_limit = 210000000

If you want to see more information about networks in the CLI you can always type:

`$ brownie networks --help`

## Working with accounts.

Brownie has a special object that allows us to interact with accounts (EOA) **with this we can query a balance or send ether from a specific account.**

For development purposes, brownie by default give us 10 accounts with false ether that we can use to test our smart contract in our ganache blockchain.

**Brownie also allow us to add accounts from our private key to the list of account in the brownie environment.**

*You can see your list of accounts by typing:*

$ brownie accounts list

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643909510496/rXqzH_3Yv.png align="left")

You probably wouldn't have any account because first you need to add it.

You can add an account in the list by using:

$ brownie accounts generate

**This will generate a random private key, and make the account available as .**

*Brownie will ask you to choose a password to encrypt this account, so it is safe.*

Also, you can import an account using its private key:

$ brownie accounts new

You will be asked to input the private key, and to choose a password. The account will then be available as .

You can see all the different method for manage account in brownie [here](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/account-management.html#local-accounts)

**But wait, this is not dangerous? Could everyone see my private key?** Don't worry, browne encrypts your private key, so when you want to use that account brownie will ask you for your password to send transactions.

To access those accounts in your scripts, you just need to import the `account` object from brownie.

*You can use the fake accounts that brownie generates.*

from brownie import accounts

my\_account\_1 = accounts\[0\] my\_account\_2 = accounts\[1\] my\_account\_3 =accounts\[9\]

Or, *you can load one of your accounts in your accounts list by using:*

from brownie import accounts

my\_personal\_account = accounts.load(id)

You provide the id of the account, and when sending the transactions brownie will ask you for the password of that account.

Also you can import the account by using the private key of the account directly, using the `add` method.

accounts.add(‘my private\_key’)

**You can mix this method, using the** `.env` **file.** There you can store your private key, so you ensure it is not going to be uploaded to github.

And then, in your brownie config file you can add a new section to store your private key using the name of that environment variable.

*(remember you need to set the section”dotenv” to points to the .env file” so you can use environment variables in your brownie config file in that format)*

![Brownie config file with new sections to store my private key.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643909984012/jsrNNx9sl.png align="left")

And then, you grab your account using the `conifg` and `accounts` object

from brownie import config, account

my\_account\_from\_private\_key = accounts.add(config\["wallets"\]\["from\_key"\])

You can read more about how to work with accounts [here.](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core-accounts.html#working-with-accounts)

## Function entry point.

*This is something to take into account when you are writing your scripts.*

**Brownie looks for a function called** `main()` **as an entry point to run your scripts**, so if that function does not exist, you will get an error like this

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643910288185/bhmVOVun1.png align="left")

You can read more about that [here.](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interaction.html?highlight=scripts#writing-scripts)

## Verify your contracts on Etherscan automatically

**You can verify all the contract source code programmatically using brownie**, tis really easy.

First, you need to create a Etherscan account

[Register on Etherscan.](https://etherscan.io/register)

*Its like every registration process*

Then, you need to create an API key to be able to interact with the Etherscan API.

In the nav bar, go to your profile and click in API keys.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643910798046/Q6BuWq4PK.png align="left")

Finally, you just need to add a new API key

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643910897877/xIXrp_ouN.png align="left")

Add that private key in your `.env` file under.

export ETHERSCAN\_TOKEN=&lt;my\_etherscan\_token&gt;

And for automatically verification you just need to add the argument `publish_source=True` to the deploy function

```python
from brownie import MyContractToken, accounts, config

my_account =  accounts.add(config["wallets"]["from_key"])

MyContractToken.deploy("My Contract Token", "CLT", 18, 1e28, {'from': my_account}, publish_source=True)
```

And you just need to run your deploy script.

$ brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network rinkeby

Ta da! Your contract is already verified on Etherscan!

It is even possible to verify contracts that you deployed earlier, as long as you didn’t change any of the code. This is done with:

`MyContractToken.publish_source(deployed_contract)`

You can read more about that [here.](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deploy.html#verifying-deployment-source-code)

### Verifying contracts on other blockchains.

Let's say you want to verify your contract on polygon, or BSC, or Fantom or whatever EVM Based chain.

The process is basically the same, you just need to go to the block explorer of that chain

* [Binance explorer](https://bscscan.com)
    
* [Polygon explorer](https://polygonscan.com/)
    
* [Arbitrum explorer](https://arbiscan.io/)
    

Create an account and create an API key that you have to paste in your .env file.

*If you get lost, follow the above tutorial using etherscan, as I said, the process is the same for most of the block explorers out there.*

For name that env variable you have to take the name of the block explorer + “\_” + “TOKEN”

Example, let's say you have your polygon scan API,

The env variable should be

export POLYGONSCAN\_TOKEN=&lt;your\_token&gt;

> For know the name of a specific explorer in the in the brownie convention, use the list of accounts and look for the `explorer` key pair the see its name

But, how does Brownie know it has to use Etherscan or any other block explorer to verify the contract?

Well, remember the `networks` object, in where we have a lot of networks to work with and all the especific [elements that a network have.](#network-elements)

```yaml
live:
  - name: Ethereum
    networks:
      - name: Ropsten (Infura)
        chainid: 3
        id: ropsten
        host: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/$WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
        explorer: https://api-ropsten.etherscan.io/api
```

In that object there is a `explorer` section that allow us to set the explorer to see the transactions.

**Brownie will knows that you would use the explorer that is under that section to verified your contracts**, and also give the links to be able to verify the transactions.

**That's all folks.**

I hope this article was helpful for you.
